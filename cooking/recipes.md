##Ingredients

* 2 (15-ounce) cans black beans (low sodium preferred), drained 
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/2 cup fat-free, low-sodium vegetable broth
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* Salt to taste
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
* 4 low-sodium whole-wheat tortillas, optional 6 corn tortillas
* 12 ounces salsa, no added sugar
* 1 cup shredded 2% Cheddar cheese

 
##Directions

Preheat oven to 375°.

Drain beans, and set aside. In the meantime, in a medium skillet, add oil; heat over medium-low heat. Add garlic, and sauté until tender, about 4 minutes. Add black beans and broth, and continue cooking approximately 3 minutes. Add cumin, black pepper, salt, and cilantro; stir to combine.

Spray the bottom of an 8x8-inch casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray. Add a tortilla, 1/4 black bean mixture, 1/4 salsa, and 1/4 cheese; continue layering until all ingredients have been used. Top casserole with remaining 1/4 cup cheese.

Cover casserole dish with foil, and bake approximately 20 minutes or until cheese is hot and bubbly. Remove foil, and continue cooking 8–10 minutes. Remove from oven, and garnish with non-fat Greek yogurt or sour cream, if desired.
