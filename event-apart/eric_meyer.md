## Designing for Crisis
by: Eric Meyer

In an emergency, you think "How do we get to location X as quickly as possible?"

### Hospitals

The GPS and the directions get you to the hospital. Then who do you talk to or where do you go?

You can go to the website, but it doesn't help when you're in shock. You can't parse or read or discover what you're looking for, when a brochure type, hospital website is what you're presented with. The content is overwhelming, vague and specialized.

Just loads, walls of text of irrelevant information in regards to "how do i deal with an emergency?"

No page reveals, "How do I get to my daughter?"

There's a phone number, but it was in the sidebar. No one remembers their phone is a phone. This is consistent with finding in cognitive science.

Study: Mentally taxing tasks impair making smart decisions and will power.

We design for our ideal users (especially upper management and marketing). We don't want our idealized users to think, but they can and we rely on it. These ideal users are a small fraction.

Our majority of our users are savvy, but not focused. They have bills to pay and not a lot of time to focus on our amazing copy or our designs. Someone that's stunned or can't even think.

### Personas:

Bobby: Potentially going to be evicted because he lost his job.
Sarah: Junior in college, mother survived breast cancer. So she knew it might happen, but just found a lump.
Jennifer: Needs to lock down her online presence in the midst of a stalker that has threatened her.

Need to find and apply personas to your site. These ones are good for credit unions.

You should know why people are using your site.

If someone is coming to your site in a crisis. They feel they need to be there for a reason.

We need to design with empathy. We shouldn't only design for these personas. "That's an edge case": an  edge case are the limits of what matter to us. By choosing to ignore edge cases, we're losing empathy and humanity. We need to bring them back to the table.

If a frightened and frustrated user can understand your site. Then everyone will be able to use your site very easily.

With your personas, you need to put them into various contexts to think about how they might respond.

Waiting room on mobile, after bedtime, midweek lunch.
Midnight, lunchtime, mid-morning.

Maybe only play creepy messages (going up!) in the elevator during the day time.

### Airports

Turn by turn directions to get to your next gate and have a countdown timer. With the average time. Maybe automatically book you a new flight when it knows you're going to miss the flight.

Even your ideal user, after they've booked flights. They're frustrated. If anyone has been in a crisis, it's even more difficult.

Maybe your mother's home was destroyed by a tornado.

Maybe your sister just had a baby.

Booking sites have a surplus of information. No one cares what the airplane is or the random features. 

Hipmunk does a great job.

Endpoints, dates with a good overlap showing how long the trip is in the date-picker. The flights show a good break down of duration, time of day and layovers at a glance.

### Automobiles

AAA is most known for roadside assistance. 

The desktop site doesn't have the roadside assistance because "people don't have a laptop on the road"

But what about when your car is dead in your driveway.

Needing to upload photos for an automobile accident, while on vacation.

Trying to upload photos, nothing showing it's uploading other than the word, "uploading". Seems frozen. Then throws an error. Restart java, restart the computer, try other browsers. Just "An error occurred" over and over.

Contact insurance and tell them, that it's not working. They say, "oh yeah, could be security settings" and they send over step by step instructions.

Why didn't they just link to that? It was all dependent on someone having java? What if they don't have java?

This was ideal being on vacation, having all the time and mental freedom to handle it.

Normally someone might need that car to get home, for a living, they probably don't have tons of website experience to be able to figure out what the problem is.

### MRI machines

White room, trying to communicate clean.

Children, would be frightened because the room doesn't communicate safety. Parents are probably stressed and scared, which scares the children.

GE has an adventure series to get kids ready for MRI machines. "Helping children's imaging go from terrifying to terrific".

Kids are often given anesthetic, to keep them still. Sometimes people are allergic, or they die, or they have a seizure and go into a coma for days.

Even in the best of circumstances, this could take 3 hours. Sedation is expensive, keeps a bed occupied, and has serious health risks.

That's why GE did the adventure series. Children's hospital of Pittsburgh also decorated with cheap party decorations and giving the children toys by saying if they stay still, they get the toys.

2005 to 2007 they went from 354 to 4 sedations. Elective wait time also decreased from 17 days to 0 days.

GE and the Hospital of Pittsburgh has decorated the machine to look like a pirate ship / space ship /  and addressed every the aspects for the children and the people managing the machines. Hypoallergenic, resistant to lots of cleaning agents, environmentally friendly. 

2009 they opened the new facility with these MRI, CT scanners, etc. Between 2009 to 2011, sedations went down 25% and the scans increased 66% which is a 55% net decrease.

### Usability testing

You need to tell them you're going to do stuff that's unusual. Shake/blur the screen. You need to consume their cognitive resources.

Replace every fifth word in the copy with dashes. Or transpose every other word.

Set a ticking clock, timers, something.


Design is a thankless task, because when it's done well it is invisible. Especially by designing for crisis, because that person will never notice it, but it's important work.
