## Designing for social behavior
by: Sarah Parameter

Social media is a tool to make something happen.

An effective social media campaign is based on the psychology of social behaviors and not the current technology.

SquareSpace and Wix are vying for our jobs, so we need to expand our skillset to stay on top.

We need to understand and be experts in social media to be able to increase our value to our team. It's important to know how to integrate with social media and not just have simple share buttons.

### The basic social ecosystm

Your persona and tone of voice

1. Publishing channels
	* Website, blog, tumblr, facebook, etc
2. Aspirational & Inspirational
	* Instagram, tumblr, pinterest
3. Support Channels
	* Twitter, email, phone, facebook
	* If you don't make a support channel, people will make one (facebook hate groups/pages)
4. Follow up channels
	* Facebook, twitter, email campaigns
	* Repurposing content from other channels in channel specific marketing ways.

Look into your data to figure out your channels and your approach. You don't need to be on a certain social media platform, just because _everyone else is on it._ For example, FDA doesn't need an instagram.

Social media value isn't number of followers, it's the number of interactions.

#### Digital Teams
* 22 Romney vs 6 Obama
* Approval takes time and social media is fast.

#### Networks

Facebook:
* Popular with the older generation
* younger generation just uses it for messaging

Instagram:
* Hip with the younger generation
* Post daily to increase follower count

Tumblr:
* Younger generation, partially anonymous, can be themselves

Twitter:
* Complainers and haters
* Celebrity followers
* Many adult gernation use it to connect with like-minded people outside their facebook friends
* Public facing, known fact

Snapchat:
* Naughty things
* Younger generations connect with brands
* Certain anonymity

LinkedIn:
* "I don't get it." _clapping_
* Professionals connecting

Followers, likes, etc can't be relied on, not viable stats. Twitter conversion is 0.04% of your followers on average from some study, for things with dollar amounts.

Engagement is roughly 25% of followers.

* Outwardly be polished and professional, on the inside, be very personal and relatable, like talking to an old friend

	* A form of authenticity in brand consistency across networks.
	* Big thing are the daily updates (commitments)
