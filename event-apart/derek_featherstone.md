## Content in Context is King
by: Derek Featherstone

We want to find wonderful experiences and re-create them.

Experiences are very contextual, there are a lot that go into moments. This happens a lot in sports, where people do the same routine to re-create great experiences, to re-live glory moments.

We're very connected (some of us more than others, sorry Derek) to our phones. Emotional attachments, we're addicted to them. To getting the newest ones.

Capturing moments with how addicted we are to our devices. Our children learn to gesture and even achieve self-actualization. 

Context in the digital world is often referred to as the device.

People do X on device Y. 

* Use Case: People are on their phone, running to catch the train.
* Actuality: People are now doing _everything_ on their phone.

You can't just put users into a box. One person might love the box, but the other person might hate the box or only enjoy the box on their own terms.

So experiences aren't about the box, it's about everything else.

### What defines context?

Time, location, proximity, device, state of mind, capabilities, activity, interests, etc...

What resolutions do we design for? We design for ALL of them.

We do that reasonably well for layout, but what about other things? Dependencies on the layout, like "Please complete the form to the right". And there's nothing on the right on mobile.

We can explicitly call out these actions with anchors and links.

Figuring out context for CTA. If it's an event, don't allow a user to click the register button if it's solid out. *Conditional Content*

Idea: If someone comes to the page on the day of the event, show the schedule instead of the homepage.

Wait. Why not do that for everyone? Yeah, that's a great idea. Figuring out the contexts for what to present to people when.

#### Context maps

##### With respect to time

Content priority over time.

Pre-event - Event - Post-event

Schedule is very important during the event.
Photos are very important after the event.
Tweets, moderately important.
Logistics & Sales are very important before the event.
Speaker Info is not very important during the actual event itself.

Percentages should be grouped for how important they are over time.

Showing content can be done programatically based on time. Your layouts can actually change based on these contexts. Time can apply to content for any industry.

##### With respect to location

Content can also be shown based on geolocation. If someone is far away from the event, we can show the user directions and logistics.

Building, block, city, farther away.

Room numbers, parking, directions, public transit, etc.

Displaying dates based on location. North America weeks start on a Sunday.

Airlines can display content for customer support if a user is inside of an airport.

Any saved context, must be resettable. I like purple shirts, but do I and will I, always only wear purple shirts?

##### With respect to proximity

Where your friends are and actions you might want to perform and interact with them.

Phone locking when untrust-worthy friends are nearby.

Asking to join a nearby friend for dinner.

Text your friend you're on your way to dinner.

If I'm in the building with my desktop, notifications on both.

If I'm away from the office, only on my phone.

If I'm on my desktop, I only want a notifications there.

##### With respect to capabilities

Someone zoomed in, flyout context menus can go off the screen.

Make larger buttons when people have a hard time clicking them.

##### With respect to activity

YouTube videos muted with captions enabled in libraries.

Maps scale appropriately when you're moving faster.

### MVP -> Minimum Viable Interaction

The smallest amount of information and functionality needed to complete an interaction.

Could we design systems and content that works for someone?

* So they don't need to unlock their phone
* so they don't need to take their phone out of their pocket
* so they don't need to open the email

For departure times, if someone sorts by shortest flight, we can bring the departure time to the top, so people using a screen reader can make quick decisions.

For duration, same thing, duration is to the top as well.

##### With respect to state of mind

Don't do mundane things, like check email at your most creative state of mind.

Can we discover and help people do things when they're in different state of minds?

If someone is anxiety, can we help them with the content?

*Content in Context is King, remember, it's not about the box.*
