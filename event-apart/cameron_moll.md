## Unified UX
by: Cameron Moll

Labels are meaningless. 

Mobile vs Desktop

Where do those blend together? data, speed, location, not limited to a certain screen size. Any device can have any constraint.

> The best interface is the one within reach

### Responsive Web Design
* The state of things the past few years
* Transitioning into a new phase using the ground work from RWD
* Apps vs Web around the world
* 49% of multi-screen users email themselves a link for continuing and activity on another device
* Short-comings
	* Assumptions about how content should be displayed
	* Disable pinch and zoom (the new fixed layout)
	* Does a one column mobile really address every need? Pinterest is rich and loaded. Can't scan and skim.
	* Gesture enabled RWD
	* RWD ends where the browser ends
	* We can't just compartmentalize desktop and mobile. Mobile is a new context, not another screen.

	
Mobile: Noun. Size, desktops will be running android by 2017.

Mobile: Verb. In the office, in the car, hotspot. 77% of mobile searches happen at home or work.

Everyone has smartphones, latest iPhones are in Ethopia. World-wide.

Windows 10, one OS for all devices. All devices are merging.

Remove the web from RWD as just Responsive Design.

### Unified
A wholistic user experience

1. Form and function
	* Function > Form (Right?)
	* Lack of unified form leads to not trusting a website
	* Form is just as important as the function
	* MyFonts.com advanced filtering on mobile
2. Data symetry
	* More than 40% of all online US users start an activity on one device and finish on another
	* Spotify, control music from different devices
	* Cart on desktop, email reminder, checked on mobile
	* Amazon and and mobile site is virtually identical

> Unify your internet presence, not just your web presence.

### #MobileFirst to #UnityFirst

Branding is the origin, the genesis, of unity. Build upon what branding has already figured out and apply that to the user experience.

Unify actions, not just content. "Sync verbs, not just nouns"

Store session data in the cloud, rather than locally.

Replace 'click' with _tap_ or _press_

Replace 'mobile' with _small_ or _mobile-ish_

Eliminate big-screen bloat. 

Do what works best for your audience.

Respect mental models, people coming from different devices will have different connotations.

#### Look into

* Web views
