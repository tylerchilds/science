## The Fault, Dear Brutus -- Career advice from a cranky old man
- Jeffry Zeldman

* Work never sells itself
* You are in the business of persuasion
* Constantly loop clients in on the goals: Focus on user's goals, research
* We're [designers/developers] not selling art
* Attitude trumps work (great work + bad attitude = fired)
* In big companies, politics trumps work (Solution: find a smaller group with no room for politics)
* "Your boss keeps in your mind who they were when they hired you" (Solution: change divisions/jobs/departments)
* If you hold contempt for the client, it will show. If you respect them, it will show. They specialize in their job and I specialize in mine.
* Sleight of hand: Talk about the important business thing you helped accomplish, not all the technical stuff
* just blog. [words, dribble/behance, or codepen]
* A list apart on github
