## Magical UX and the Internet of Things
by: Josh Clark

The interaction is moving from a screen, into the world around us. Physical interfaces for digital systems.

Speech and gestures: magic wands.

The best interface reduces the number of steps to achieve the results. Taking intent and translating it into action.

Taking simple actions and connecting them together. Hand gesture to take a screenshot, touch your phone to share it.

### Three Acts

1. Magic & Technology
	* Arther C. Clarke came up again.
	* What's magic today is normal tomorrow.
	* We also set our bar really low. Why aren't we pushing the limits more?
	* It's usually more about the technology
	* "One Goal: The computer disappears into the environment" - Alan Kay
	* Get as close as possible to the content and the interactions. GUI vs the command line.
	* "Fantasy fulfills a need for a simpler, more controllable world." - Alan Kay
		* Driving a car is super simple to do, but a crazy machine under the hood.
	* The phone is the first Magic Wand for everyone!
	* The phone is the first Internet of Things device for everyone
		* Sensors + Smarts + Connectivity
	* You can get information about things right in front of you. A computer that interacts with the world around us
	* Mobile phones bring computing power to immobile objects
		* Anything can be a sensor/communicator
		* Diaper interfaces: Nappy Notifier
	* We add sensors to our bodies, but we always go back to our phones. The phones are in between us and the world.
	* 3 hours and 16 minutes per day is the average smart phone usage
	* "The more connected we are, the more disconneted we are."
	* Interaction With the point of inspiration
		* Memory mirror, look at yourself in the mirror, recorded, playback, various colors, comparisons.
	* We need to learn from history and stories to see design patterns
		* Sorting hat, evil mirrors, self sweeping brooms, ruby slippers to escape
	* Physical buttons and interactions in the world, IfTTT, amazon dash
	* Let's not try and solve everything with a screen. If all problems are solved with a screen, then we'll never escape them.
2. Physical Meets Digital
	* Physical interactions with a digital API
	* The world is the interface (like it always has been)
	* The world is a data source, how can we create interfaces that only listen?
		* Progressive snapshot: passive interface that gathers information on your driving habits.
		* Automatic: integrates with your car and gives the driver insight into the car, error codes and coaches for driving habits.
	* Good passive interfaces don't change behaviour.
		* An inhaler that lets you know when, where, how often you need it.
			* Gather large data "An hour after walking through here, uptick in people using inhalers"
		* New Crystal Ball is just big data.
	* Automagical vs Magical
		* Our actions are a source of data, or control. Not automatic, because we do things. Gestures and response. Devices that just listen to our actions.
		* Physical sand table with a digital projector and reads the topography and layout.
	* The world is reactive.
	* <http://presto.watch> Gestures from your wrist watch.
	* Wearables to Thereables
		* Objects in the world are just interactive
	* The world is a big canvas
	* Room-e an interactive room.
	* Instead of wearing a wrist band to track sleep, shouldn't the mattress be doing that instead?
	* Don't be a jerk. Don't use location information to walk up to someone and then punch them in the face with an ad.
	* Wayfinder is for the London Underground that helps blind people navigate the tubes. "My first steps towards independence on the tubes"
	* Thaw, MIT project for a phone interacting with a screen.
	* We create physical interfaces that we bring through the world
3. Magic, Imagined
	* Google Glass, instead of what can we put on your face with a bunch of features? 
		* What if this was magic?
	* A coffee cup has a lot of contexts and emotions.
		* What if it could listen, talk to its brothers or what is it's 
	* Design for the things essential thingness. It's context and use is the important part of it. Instead of what can we automate, what can we amplify?
	* Burj Khalifa binoculars. See the world, but also see it at night or 50 years ago.
	* Bank on Illusion and embrace misdirection
	* Vessyl, a smart cup. Tells you what it is in it and how many calories are in it.
	* Don't just add data, add insight.
		* Connected does not mean smart and smart does not mean good.
	* Talking is not the goal, the goal should be better conversation.
	* People feel that magic always goes wrong.
	* "How smart does your bed have to be before you're afraid to go to sleep at night?"
	* We need to build systems that honor intentions but don't assume it. My hand should beat the smart lock.
	* Let's not build cyborgs, let's amplify our humanity.
	* The ~~magic~~ internet of things is not about the THING.
 
#### Abridged
1. Magic and Technology tl;dr
	* The Computer is invisible at the point of inspiration, using embeded smarts drawn from centuries of ideas.
2. Physical & Digital
	* Gather data for insight
	* Channel Intention
	* Use the whole big canvas
	* interactions have mass
3. Magic, Imagined
	* What if this was magic?
		* It's more about the human
	* Add insight, not just data
		* Why are we building what we're building?
	* Honor intention, don't assume it
	* Make it encalming & humane

This is not a challenge of technology. It's a challenge of imagination.

Let's make technology that makes joy and amplifies humanity. Let's change the world and help the people who need it, rather than corporations.

### Take aways

It's very similar to events from programming. We have events and data about events. We handle those events, so we already have a common pattern to be able to follow and do amazing things. Event triggers and event listeners.
